<p class="ex">John Baskerville (1706–1775) was an English businessman whose entrepreneurial attentions included <em>japanning</em> and <em>papier-mâché</em>; he is, however, best remembered as a typographer and printer, not least for the design of the eponymous typeface which, to this very day, bears his name.</p>

title=" John Baskerville designed his famous serif typeface in 1757."/>

<p class="dropcap1">Baskerville was born in the village of Wolverley, near Kidderminster in Worcestershire, and worked as a printer in Birmingham. Baskerville printed works for the University of Cambridge and, although an atheist, printed a splendid folio bible in 1763. His typefaces were greatly admired by Benjamin Franklin, a printer and fellow member of the Royal Society of Arts, who took the designs back to the newly-created United States, where they were adopted for most federal government publishing.</p>

<p>Baskerville was responsible for numerous innovations in printing, paper and ink production. He developed a technique which produced a smoother whiter paper which showcased his strong black type. He also pioneered a completely new style of typography, adding wide margins and generous leading to improve legibility.</p>

<blockquote>
    “Having been an early admirer of the beauty of letters, I became insensibly desirous of contributing to the perfection of them. I formed to myself ideas of greater accuracy than had yet appeared, and had endeavoured to produce a set of types according to what I conceived to be their true proportion.”
    <br>
<cite>—John Baskerville, preface to Milton, 1758 (Anatomy of a Typeface)</cite></blockquote>

title=" John Baskerville designed his famous serif typeface in 1757."/>

<p class="dropcap1">Baskerville is a Transitional serif typeface designed by John Baskerville in 1757, positioned between the Old Style typefaces of William Caslon, and the modern styles of Giambattista Bodoni and Firmin Didot.</p>

<p>The typeface is the result of Baskerville’s intent to improve upon the types of William Caslon. He increased the contrast between thick and thin strokes, making the serifs sharper and more tapered, and shifted the axis of rounded letters to a more vertical position. The curved strokes are more circular in shape, and the characters became more regular. These changes created a greater consistency in size and form.</p>

<p>Baskerville’s work was criticised by jealous competitors and soon fell out of favour. Since the 1920s, however, numerous revivals of Baskerville have been released by Linotype, Monotype, and other type foundries. Émigré released a popular revival of the typeface in 1996 called Mrs Eaves, named for Baskerville’s wife, Sarah Eaves. Baskerville represents the peak of Transitional type face design and bridges the gap between Old Style and Modern type design.</p>

    <img src="img/mrs-eaves.png" alt="Mrs Eaves typeface."
title=" John Baskerville designed his famous serif typeface in 1757."/>

<p class="dropcap1">Mrs Eaves is named after Sarah Eaves, the woman who became John Baskerville’s wife. As Baskerville was setting up his printing and type business, Mrs. Eaves moved in with him as a live-in housekeeper, eventually becoming his wife after the death of her first husband, Mr. Eaves. Mrs Eaves is a revival of the types of English printer and punchcutter John Baskerville, and is related to contemporary Baskerville typefaces.</p>

<p>Like Baskerville, Mrs Eaves, cut by Zuzana Licko of Émigré, has a near vertical stress, departing from the Old Style model. Identifying characters, similar to Baskerville’s types, are the lowercase g with its open lower counter and swash-like ear. Both the roman and italic uppercase Q have a flowing swash-like tail. The uppercase C has serifs at top and bottom; there is no serif at the apex of the central junction in uppercase W; and the uppercase G has a sharp spur suggesting a vestigial serif.</p>

<h2>Part 1 – Pioneers of European Type Design</h2>

<p>In this series we take a look at the development of type design throughout Europe from Jenson’s classic design to the strength of Bodoni’s timeless creation.</p>

<p class="dropcap1">Nicholas Jenson (1420 – 1480) was a French engraver, pioneer, printer and type designer who carried out most of his work in Venice, Italy. Jenson acted as <em>Master of the French Royal Mint</em> at Tours, and is credited as the creator of one of the finest early Roman typefaces.</p>

<p>Nicholas Jenson was something of an iconic figure among students of early printing since the nineteenth century, when the aesthete <b>William Morris</b> praised the beauty and perfection of his Roman font. Jenson is an important figure in the early history of printing and a pivotal force in the emergence of Venice as one of the first great centres of the printing press.</p>

<p class="dropcap1">Claude Garamont (1510 – 1561), known commonly as Claude Garamond, was a French type designer, publisher and punchcutter based in Paris. Garamond worked as an engraver of punches, the masters used to stamp matrices, the moulds used to cast metal type. He worked in the tradition of what is now called old-style serif letter design, that produced letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen but with a slightly more structured and upright design.</p>

<p>Garamond is now considered one of the leading type designers of all time. He is recognised to this day for the elegance of his typefaces.</p>

<h3 id="William Caslon">William Caslon</h3>

    <img src="img/william-caslon.png" alt="William Caslon."
title="William Caslon Portrait."/>
    
<p class="dropcap1">William Caslon I (1692 – 1766), also known as William Caslon the Elder, was an English gunsmith and designer of typefaces. The distinction and legibility of his type secured him the patronage of the leading printers of the day in England and the continent. His typefaces transformed English type design and first established an English national typographic style.</p>

<p>Caslon was born in Cradley, Worcestershire in 1692 and trained as an engraver in nearby Birmingham. In 1716, he started business in London as an engraver of gun locks and barrels and as a bookbinder's tool cutter. Having contact with printers, he was induced to fit up a type foundry, largely through the encouragement of <b>William Bowyer</b>.’</p>

<blockquote>“ ‘Legibility’ is based on the ease with which one letter can be told from the other. ‘Readability’ is the ease with which the eye can absorb the message and move along the line.”

   <img src="img/giambattista_bodoni.png" alt="Giambattista Bodoni."
title="Giambattista Bodoni Portrait."/> 
    
    <p class="dropcap1">Giambattista Bodoni (1740 – 1813) was an Italian typographer, type designer, compositor, printer and publisher in Parma. He first took the type designs of <b>Pierre Simon Fournier</b> as his exemplars, but afterwards became an admirer of the more modelled types of <b>John Baskerville</b>; and he and <b>Firmin Didot</b> evolved a style of type called 'New Face', in which the letters are cut in such a way as to produce a strong contrast between the thick and thin parts of their body.</p>

<p>Bodoni designed many typefaces, each one in a large range of sizes. He is even more admired as a compositor, as the large range of sizes which he cut enabled him to compose his pages with the greatest possible subtlety of spacing. Like Baskerville, he set off his texts with wide margins and used little or no decoration.</p>
